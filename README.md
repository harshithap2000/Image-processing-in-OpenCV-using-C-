# Image Processing in OpenCV using C++
##Please visit [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BM1yOakToHtPzM7-ZmgMAEcIuYzFbk8D/view?usp=sharing) for results and analysis of the transforms (with sample output images).
The following image enhancements can be done using the program.
1. Reading an 8 bit grayscale image and writing a code to generate the image of 7 bit, 6 bit, 5
bit, 4 bit, 3 bit, 2 bit and 1 bit image.
2. Reading a grayscale image and performing the Zooming and Shrinking operation on it.
Considerinf the Zooming factor as 2 and shrinking factor as 0.5
3. Reading a grayscale image and performing the gamma correction method on it to enhance the
image. Analyzing the result by varying gamma value.
4. Reading a low contrast grayscale image, implementing and demonstrating the Histogram
Equalization code for enhancing the low contrast image.
5. Reading a grayscale image, implementing the bit plane slicing and combining 7bit and 6bit, 6
bit and 5 bit, 5 bit and 4bit.
6. Reading a grayscale image, implementing and demonstrating the Edge detector of an image
using Laplacian Edge Detector.
